# Searching
##Linear Search : A linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. 
It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

Binary Search : Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval  covering the whole array.
If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half.Otherwise narrow it to the upper half.
Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.
    
Binary Search works faster than Linear Search but it has one limitation that elements need to be entered in either ascending or descending order
